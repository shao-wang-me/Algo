# 535. Encode and Decode TinyURL

<https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/>

This is an easy problem. The problem setup is really dumb, because it checks your code this way:

```
# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.decode(codec.encode(url))
```

So you can just return `longUrl`. Even if you do store the longUrl, you cannot test the collision because there is only one `longUrl` each time!

But it is worth having a look at [the design of a real world TinyURL system](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/124658/Design-a-URL-Shortener-(-TinyURL-)-System/).

## Just integer ID

```python3
class Codec:
  def __init__(self):
    self.entries = []

  def encode(self, longUrl: str) -> str:
    length = len(self.entries)
    self.entries.append(longUrl)
    return length

  def decode(self, shortUrl: str) -> str:
    return self.entries[int(shortUrl)]
```

Complexity
- n = number of `longUrl`s
- Time: O(n), each `encode` and `decode` is O(1)
- Space: O(n), we need to store n `longUrl`s

Performance
- Time: 32ms, beats 96.89%
- Space: 14.8mb, beats 66.67%

## Random string

This is a slightly more proper version that makes sure we generate random strings and generates the same `shortUrl` for the same `longUrl`.

```python3
import random, string

class Codec:
  _chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
  _tiny_len = 8  # Can be increased if not enough over the time, but (26 + 10) ^ 8 is a already huge number.

  def __init__(self):
    self.long2tiny = {}
    self.tiny2long = {}
  
  @classmethod
  def get_random_tiny(cls):
    return ''.join(random.choices(cls._chars, k=cls._tiny_len))

  def encode(self, longUrl: str) -> str:
    while longUrl not in self.long2tiny:
      shortUrl = self.get_random_tiny()
      if shortUrl not in self.tiny2long:
        self.tiny2long[shortUrl] = longUrl
        self.long2tiny[longUrl] = shortUrl
        return shortUrl

  def decode(self, shortUrl: str) -> str:
    return self.tiny2long[shortUrl]
```

Complexity
- n = number of `longUrl`s
- Time: O(n), collision is expected to be very few
- Space: O(n), needs n * 2 space to store the forward and reverse mappings

Performance
- Time: 40ms, beats 63.11%
- Space: 14.8mb, beats 68.45%

# Just for fun, just return `longUrl`

```python3
class Codec:
  def encode(self, longUrl: str) -> str:
    return longUrl

  def decode(self, shortUrl: str) -> str:
    return shortUrl
```

Performance
- Time: 40ms, beats 63.11%
- Space: 14.7mb, beats 94.67%

Interestingly, this takes more time than the integer ID version.
